/**
 * The interface for text-to-speech engines. This class behaves like
 * a factory for speech channels, which are used for synthesizing human
 * voice. Various engines are created by loaded extensions and registered
 * by LUWRAIN core. Any particular synthesizer is address by the name of
 * the corresponding engine.
 * <p>
 * As it is mentioned previously, this interface mostly takes care of
 * creating the engine channels for speech synthesizing. Normally LUWRAIN
 * may request any number of speech channels of any particular engine and
 * all of them must work completely independently.
 * <p>
 * Whenever creation of a new channel is requested, LUWRAIN provides
 * a map of channel parameters. The purpose of these parameters is
 * engine-dependent, LUWRAIN does not impose any exact meaning.
 * Typically the entire list of speech channel parameters is specified by
 * a user through the control panel or through the command line
 * arguments. The engine itself is addressed by its name, which is the
 * same as the name of {@link ExtensionObject}.
 * <p>
 * In addition the {@code Engine} interface provides an set of engine features
 * helping the core to understand what this engine can do. LUWRAIN does
 * not expect that all engines support all features, it's absolutely
 * normal to have some engines with partial functionality.
