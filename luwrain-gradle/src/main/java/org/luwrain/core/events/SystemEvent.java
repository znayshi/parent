/**
 * An event addressed to one or several areas and not related to user
 * input. System events are delivered to areas through 
 * {@code onSystemEvent()} method and notifies that area should do some
 * action which certainly not related to user input.  The area may decide
 * on its own whether it would like to perform the required action or to
 * ignore it. There can be both system-defined system events and
 * extension-defined. Generally, there are three major types of
 * system events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Regular events</li>
 * <li>Broadcast events</li>
 * <li>Addressed events</li>
 * </ul>
 * If regular events are placed in main event loop, they are always
 * delivered to the currently active area. Meantime, it is also quite usual
 * practice to send to the area a regular event directly, if you have a
 * reference to this area. This means that you just want to ask the area
 * to do some action (for example, to refresh its content or to save the
 * unsaved data), and there are no problems with that.
 * <p>
 * Broadcast events are always delivered to the areas through main event
 * loop (otherwise they are pointless).  If LUWRAIN core finds such event
 * in main event loop, it tries to decide which areas should get it,
 * depending on the class name of the area or on the uniref value (see
 * {@code getBroadcastFilterAreaClassName()} and {@code
 * getBroadcastFilterUniRef()} methods). Broadcast events are delivered
 * over all launched applications.
 * <p>
 * Addressed events are always delivered to some particular area, even if
 * they are placed in main event loop. Usually they are useful for thread
 * synchronization because handling of the events is always done in main
 * system thread while they can be issued in any thread. The only
 * restriction is that the application which has issued this event must
 * be still launched when the event is processed.
