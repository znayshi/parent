 * Provides all necessary additional data about the area shown to user in

 * which main distinguish is that their appearance initiates new instance
 * of the message loop. 
 *
 * The popups can be shown as a single method invocation but since that
 * freezes processing of input and environment events this feature is
 * implemented with launching new temporary copy of event loop
 * procedure. So the key attribute is a flag which signals that new event
 * loop can be stopped. If the popup object is prepared its real start
 * should be done with Luwrain.popup() method.
