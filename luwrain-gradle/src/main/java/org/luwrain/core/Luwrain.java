/**
 * The main bridge for applications and extensions purposed for communication with
 * LUWRAIN core. This class is a central object to be used by
 * applications and extensions to call system routines. Applications and
 * extensions never have the access with the level deeper than this
 * class. The packages like {@code org.luwrain.controls} or 
 * {@code org.luwrain.popups} always wrap the instance of {@code Luwrain} class
 * (meaning, are unable to give more access to system core than provided
 * with given instance of {@code Luwrain} class).
 * <p>
 * The core creates new instance of this class for each newly launched
 * application or loaded extension. Therefore, the environment is always
 * aware which application oor extension has issued the particular
 * request. Applications get the object associated with them through
 * {@code onLaunch()} method. Extensions get the corresponding instance
 * through the argument for the methods they override (it is always the
 * same instance provided this way just for convenience). Everybody is
 * encouraged to keep provided instance in secret. 
 * <p>
 * It could be slightly confusing that the extension and the applications
 * launched by this extension get different instances of {@code Luwrain}
 * class, but it's necessary to distinguish multiple instances of the
 * particular application (while an extension can be loaded only once).
 * <p>
 * Various instance of {@code Luwrain} class may provide different level
 * of access.  It is necessary to make extensions using more accurate and
 * transparent.
