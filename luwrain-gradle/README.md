LUWRAIN develops technologies which improve the accessibility of internet services and digital materials
to people with eyesight problems. We are designing a new speech-enabled user interface and are researching
new methods of adapting materials for blind people with the help of machine learning.

The core of the LUWRAIN project is a platform for the creation of apps for the blind and partially-sighted.
It brings a new user experience designed to achieve maximum efficiency. The LUWRAIN platform provides
an open API on top of Java language, which helps to build accessible apps in a portable way. LUWRAIN,
together with a set of standard utilities, can be launched as a standalone operating system on the Linux
kernel. It is the most advanced approach to making Raspberry Pi accessible to the blind.
